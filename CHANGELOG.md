Change Log
==========

## Version 0.5.0

Initial release. Project is functional, though UI leaves much to be desired. There
are four initial generator types with at least one generator defined for each: seed
points, piece generation, tab placement, and tab generation. Not every piece generator
uses seed points. Basic SVG export is supported as well as simple whimsy piece support.
